# Cement-Mixer-IoT-Data-Pipeline
Cement Mixure machine's IoT Data Pipeline is a project that processes IoT data from cement mixture machine's sensors to predict its consistancy and strenght.

## Project Overview

Cement Mixure machine's IoT Data Pipeline is a project that processes IoT data from cement mixture sensors. The project implements ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and creates efficient data pipelines to handle real-time sensor data, perform necessary transformations, and load the processed data into a target system for analysis and reporting.
