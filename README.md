# Cement-Mixer-IoT-Data-Pipeline
Cement Mixure machine's IoT Data Pipeline is a project that processes IoT data from cement mixture machine's sensors to predict its consistancy and strenght.

## Project Overview

Cement Mixure machine's IoT Data Pipeline is a project that processes IoT data from cement mixture sensors. The project implements ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes and creates efficient data pipelines to handle real-time sensor data, perform necessary transformations, and load the processed data into a target system for analysis and reporting.

## Features

- Real-time data ingestion from cement mixture sensors
- Data cleaning, normalization, and enrichment
- Automated ETL pipeline with error handling and recovery
- Data quality assurance checks
- Performance optimization for large-scale data processing
- Integration with data warehouse and analytics platforms
- Basic dashboards for data monitoring
- Anomaly detection and predictive maintenance capabilities
